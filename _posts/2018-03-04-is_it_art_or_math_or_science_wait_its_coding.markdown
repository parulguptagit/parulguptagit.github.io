* With just 26 letters in the english alphabet a writer can create a new world for the reader. 
* With just 7 notes in music, musicians create extraoridinary symphonies. 
* An artist just needs Red Green and Blue colors to create life on an empty canvas.

And that my friend is precisely why I learnt how to code. Coding gives you the power to create. There are just 32 keywords in C and C++, some 50 odd in Java. The world around us is dancing to the tune of social media, apps and smart devices which are all nothing without the code running behind it. Code has the power to make Alexa your shrink. 

*"I always considered programming as being like modern-day wizardry. You could think of things in your mind and then make them happen." -Jeff Minter*


A coder finds beauty and elegance in brevity of code, the excitement of problem solving, the gnawing sleepless nights of code stuck at that wierd error, the eureka moment of finding a solution, and the never ending quest for perfection.  

*“The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver. No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.” 
― Joseph Weizenbaum*

It is this high of being the creator with innumerable ideas, languages and platforms available to make your own little masterpiece that makes me want to learn to code, and code beautifully.

*Everyday life is like programming, I guess. If you love something you can put beauty into it - Donald Knuth*
